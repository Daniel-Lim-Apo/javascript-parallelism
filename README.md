Tutorial Javascript Parallelism - Examples

Parallelism in JavaScript refers to executing multiple tasks simultaneously to improve performance and efficiency, especially for CPU-bound tasks.

Unlike languages ​​like C++ or Java, JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time. However, JavaScript supports asynchronous operations and can leverage parallelism through several mechanisms.

Here are some of the main methods for achieving parallelism in JavaScript that allow JavaScript to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance for I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks.

1. Web Workers
provide a way to run scripts on background threads. They allow you to perform tasks without interfering with the user interface.

2. Promises and Async/Await
Promises and `async/await` are used to handle asynchronous operations, allowing the main thread to continue executing other tasks while waiting for an operation to complete.

3. Parallel Promises
You can execute multiple promises in parallel using `Promise.all`.

4. Using `map` with `Promise.all`
When you have an array of tasks that you want to execute in parallel, you can use `map` in combination with `Promise.all`.

5. Node.js Worker Threads
In Node.js, you can use worker threads to achieve parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.
